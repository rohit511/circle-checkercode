# circle-checkercode code go through


Sure, let's go through the code step by step:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This is the document type declaration, specifying that the document is an HTML5 document.

<html>: The opening tag for the root HTML element.

<head>: The head section of the HTML document, where you define the metadata and include external resources.

<title>Circularity Checker</title>: Sets the title of the web page, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

<style>: The opening tag for the style section, where we define CSS rules.

#canvas { ... }: This CSS rule targets the canvas element with the ID "canvas" and applies some styling. It adds a black border around the canvas and sets the cursor to a crosshair when hovering over the canvas.

</style>: The closing tag for the style section.

</head>: The closing tag for the head section.

<body>: The body section of the HTML document, where the visible content of the page is defined.

<h1>Draw a figure and check its circularity!</h1>: Displays a heading on the page instructing the user to draw a figure.

<canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>: This creates an HTML5 canvas element with an ID of "canvas" and sets its width and height attributes to 400 pixels each. The canvas is where the user will draw the figure.

<p>Similarity to a circle: <span id="circularity">0%</span></p>: Creates a paragraph element with some text and a nested span element with the ID "circularity". This is where we will display the circularity percentage.

<script>: The opening tag for the script section, where we write JavaScript code.

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');: This line creates a constant variable named canvas and assigns it the reference to the canvas element with the ID "canvas".

const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');: This line creates a constant variable named ctx and assigns it the 2D rendering context of the canvas. The context is used to draw on the canvas.

const circularityElement = document.getElementById('circularity');: This line creates a constant variable named circularityElement and assigns it the reference to the span element with the ID "circularity", where we will display the circularity percentage.

let drawnPoints = [];: This line creates an array named drawnPoints to store the points of the figure being drawn.

let isDrawing = false;: This line creates a boolean variable named isDrawing and sets it to false. This variable will be used to track if the user is currently drawing or not.

canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', startDrawing);: This line adds a mousedown event listener to the canvas. When the user clicks the mouse, the startDrawing function will be called.

canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw);: This line adds a mousemove event listener to the canvas. When the user moves the mouse (while holding the mouse button down), the draw function will be called.

canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', endDrawing);: This line adds a mouseup event listener to the canvas. When the user releases the mouse button, the endDrawing function will be called.

function startDrawing(event) { ... }: This is the startDrawing function, which is called when the user clicks the mouse on the canvas. It sets isDrawing to true and initializes the drawnPoints array.

function draw(event) { ... }: This is the draw function, which is called when the user moves the mouse while holding the mouse button down. It adds the current mouse position to the drawnPoints array and draws the figure on the canvas.

function endDrawing() { ... }: This is the endDrawing function, which is called when the user releases the mouse button. It sets isDrawing to false, calculates the circularity of the drawn figure, and displays the result on the page.

function calculateCircularity(points) { ... }: This is the calculateCircularity function, which takes the array of drawn points as input and calculates the circularity percentage of the drawn figure.

</script>: The closing tag for the script section.

</body>: The closing tag for the body section.

</html>: The closing tag for the root HTML element.

Note: The code defines event listeners to track the mouse actions (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) on the canvas and draw the figure accordingly. When the user finishes drawing, the circularity is calculated based on the drawn figure's area and perimeter compared to a perfect circle. The result is displayed as a percentage in the designated <span> element.
